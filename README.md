addToCalendar
===============

A PHP class to generate HTML buttons to add events to various calendars.

Enable your users to add events directly to their favorite calendar.
These buttons do not need javascript - they work inside emails too.

The buttons are generated using the PHP class. Load the class, fill up the required values, and generate the buttons anywhere.

See a [demo](http://www.clusterdev.com/add-to-calendar/).
